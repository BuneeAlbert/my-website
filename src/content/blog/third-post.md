## Understanding Web Performance: A Deep Dive into Core Web Vitals

Web performance isn't just about speed—it's about delivering a smooth, responsive experience that keeps users engaged. In this post, we'll explore Google's Core Web Vitals and how they impact your site's success.

### What Are Core Web Vitals?

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. They measure three key aspects:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance
2. **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures interactivity
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability

### Why They Matter

- Better conversion rates
